The plotting_of_angles file contains the script for plotting T1 events 

IMPORTANT : The only thing that need to be taken into account is to adjust the start, stop and step number before running the script(Line 33).

If the image number starts with 301 and ends with 499 then start point must be selected as 301 , stop point must be 499 and step is 1.
